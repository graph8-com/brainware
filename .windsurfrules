Tech Stack

Frameworks and Libraries: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI.​
Extensions and Servers: Chrome Extension, Express.js.​
Naming Conventions

Directories: Use lowercase with dashes (e.g., components/form-wizard).​
Exports: Favor named exports for components and utilities.​
Component Files: Use PascalCase (e.g., VisaForm.tsx).​
Utility Files: Use camelCase (e.g., formValidator.ts).​
TypeScript Usage

Codebase: Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.​
Enums: Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion.​
Components: Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.​
Message Passing: Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension.​
Imports: Use absolute imports for all files (e.g., @/components/Button).​
Error Handling: Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's a good reason to translate or handle errors in that abstraction.​
Function Returns: Use explicit return types for all functions.​
Chrome Extension Specific

Manifest: Use Manifest V3 standards.​
Message Passing: Implement proper message passing between components:
typescript
Copy
Edit
  interface MessagePayload {
    type: string;
    data: unknown;
  }
Permissions: Handle permissions properly in manifest.json.​
Storage: Use chrome.storage.local for persistent data.
