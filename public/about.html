                    <p>
                        I've spent the better part of the last two decades starting, building, and scaling companies. In the early days, I was building instinctively—less structured, more reactive. Over time, I learned how to focus, apply discipline, and harness agency to take control of outcomes. That shift is what allowed me to build companies that don't just start—they survive and scale.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        My first company, AddAShop, launched during the dot-com boom. It was an early e-commerce platform designed to help small businesses sell online using big distributors' inventory. We were early—too early—and when the crash came, the business didn't survive. But I kept it alive, more as a reminder than anything else.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The first real success came in 2008 with Adility, a platform for digital offers and promotions. Adility was created to solve for online to offline attribution, a major issue still today. Little did I know at the start we were able to utilize our platform and expand into cash payments, digital assets, bill payments and many other use cases at the point of sales and accessible in over 450,000 locations worldwide. We built it up and sold it to InComm in 2012. That opened doors and gave me the momentum to launch and grow a series of companies in the years that followed:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Armatic: A financial automation platform, which was acquired by BlueSnap.</li>
                        <li>Helpware: A global CX outsourcing firm, which experienced rapid growth and was later acquired by Eir Partners in 2022.</li>
                        <li>eTeam: A scalable software development company, which was also acquired by Eir Partners.</li>
                        <li>CIENCE: A category leader in B2B lead generation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        Both CIENCE and Helpware experienced rapid growth, each scaling to over 1,000 employees. This simultaneous expansion created a dynamic environment where both companies thrived, ultimately leading to Helpware's acquisition by Eir Partners in 2022.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        CIENCE grew fast—3,000% in three years, top 200 on the Inc. 500, thousands of employees worldwide. But in 2023, we hit a wall. Market shifts and changing buyer behavior forced us to make hard decisions, including reducing the size of our team. It was painful. But we didn't fold—we adjusted. We kept going. And now CIENCE is back in growth mode, healthy, and aiming for $50M+ in revenue.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Along the way, I also started Graph8, a next-gen CDP and CRM built from everything I've learned—modular, integrated, and designed for real profitability from the beginning. It's ready to scale now too.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Those years—across wins and setbacks—led me to build Brainware. I didn't want to keep doing startups the old way: pitch decks, endless fundraising, bloated teams. I wanted to build companies differently—with a model focused on profitability first, keeping founders in control, and reducing reliance on external capital.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        At Brainware, we build the company first—from scratch. We validate the opportunity, set up the systems, close the first customers. Then we bring in the right founder to take the lead and scale it further. We surround them with shared resources in sales, finance, ops, and engineering, all built to support fast but sustainable growth.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        What I'm focused on now is finding the next generation of builders—people like me, who actually enjoy the insane phase of starting from zero. Not managers. Makers. Doers. People who aren't afraid to write the first line of code or make the first 100 cold calls themselves. As I always say: "Do everything yourself—at least once." Because when you've done it, no one can BS you.
                    </p>

                        That mindset—scrappy, focused, and outcome-driven—is at the heart of Brainware. It's not about chasing unicorns. It's about building real companies, with real revenue, that create real value.
